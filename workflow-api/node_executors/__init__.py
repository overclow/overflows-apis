"""
Node executors package - organizes node execution functions by category

This package contains all node executor functions organized by their functional category:
- prompt_nodes: Text and prompt enhancement nodes
- image_nodes: Image generation and analysis nodes  
- animation_nodes: Animation and video generation nodes
- model_3d_nodes: 3D model generation and optimization nodes
- utility_nodes: Utility nodes like save_result, fusion, etc.
"""

# For now, we'll keep all executors in a single workflow_engine module
# to minimize disruption and maintain all existing functionality.
# This modular structure is set up for future refactoring.
